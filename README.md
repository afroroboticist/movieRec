# movieRec
A recommender that utilizes ratings for finding your favorite movies
The idea behind creating this is to see how various models interprete movie data and the differences in predictions across these models.
Dataset being used for developing this is Kaggle's Movie Dataset.

Tell us your favorite movie and we'll tell you a few movies you may want to see. *wink*
